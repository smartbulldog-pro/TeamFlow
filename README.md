## 🎯 What TeamFlow Is For

TeamFlow is designed as a flexible foundation you can adapt to many use cases:

- Team collaboration (members, roles, permissions)
- Analytics and reporting (tables, charts, dashboards)

## 🔧 What You Can Build On Top

Here are a few ideas you can implement on top of TeamFlow:

It is a foundation you own and extend to match your specific business needs.
